= Deploying Generic Services in RHPDS

. Check out the git repo at https://github.com/rut31337/order_svc

. Use the command like this:
+
----
./order_svc.sh -c "Workshops" -i "CloudForms 4.5 Workshop" \
 -u <generic_login> -w "https://rhpds.redhat.com" \
 -t 2 -d "autostart=t;noemail=t"
----

[NOTE]
The -t specifies the number of instances to deploy.  autostart=t will start the environments autostart=f will create them but not start.  The setting noemail=t is recommended as you do not want to get an email sent to you for every environment.  GUIDs are retrieved as documented below.

. Get your GUIDs using this:
+
----
./get_svcs.sh -c "Workshops" -i "CloudForms 4.5 Workshop" \
 -u <generic_login> -w "https://rhpds.redhat.com" \
 -o services.txt
cat services.txt |cut -f5 -d- > guids.txt
